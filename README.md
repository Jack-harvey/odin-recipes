# odin-recipes

First project within the Odin Project course

This is the first project and will showcase the theory taught up until this point.

HTML is the only thing on display here and so it will look a little bare-bones.
We'll also be using git to commit following along with best practices.

You can find the live site <a href="https://jack-harvey.github.io/odin-recipes/">here<a> hosted on github.
